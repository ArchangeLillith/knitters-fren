How the cache should look!!

cache: {
  allPatterns: {
    [pattern_id] : {
      {object of type PatternObject}
      }
    ...
  }
  allTags: {
    [tag_id] : {name: string} //we don't need id cause it's the key. This is scalable, so we don't need to redo things if we add something else to the tags
  }
}
