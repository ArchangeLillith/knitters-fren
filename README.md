<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="/public/images/screenshots/home-page.png" alt="home page screenshot" width="1000" height="500">

This project was originally a blog post, but I felt that was less fun than making a functional website to host all my favorite knitting patterns! Under the hood it's very similar to a blog website having users, posts, tags but also incorporates those in other, more advanced ways - like the search function. The search function allows users to click a tag tile and be transported to the search with that tag already selected. The user can also select more tags and also search with plain text! 


I'm hoping that the more organized my patterns are, the more I and other knitters want to knit fun things.

### Built With

* [![React][React.js]][React-url]
* [![Bootstrap][Bootstrap.com]][Bootstrap-url]
* [![SASS][SASS]][SASS-url]

I challenged myself to only use Bootstrap and a touch of SASS for styling in this project as I want to understand more what Bootstrap has to offer. I deviated a bit for minor things such as font styling or small color changes that aren't Bootstrap native.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

While this project isn't deployed, you can download the files into a folder called "Knitters Fren" and run ``npm install`` on the root to get your node modules good to go. 

### Installation


1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ArchangeLillith/knitters-fren
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Boot the project (backend lives on localhost:3000, frontend lives on localhost:8000)
    ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

<img src="/public/images/screenshots/detail-view.png" alt="details page screenshot" width="1000" height="500">

I've found it challenging to know which of my patterns I'm looking for based on file name alone, and sometimes I forget I have a really pretty pattern I haven't used in a while. I'm hoping with the addition of pictures that I can more easily find what I'm looking for, and with the featured section rotating on every load I'll be exposed to more patterns!

As this website gets deployed and there are more users, I'm also hoping we can make a positive enviornment that people can share wonderful patterns they've used and it becomes a place that knitters can find wonderful new patterns to try.
